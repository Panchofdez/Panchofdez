### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at Ryerson University looking to delve into the software engineering world. I'm interested in full-stack web-development, blockchain technology and machine learning.

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- React/React-Native
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- HTML/CSS

These are the technologies that I know and but I'm hoping to add much more to my toolbelt 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a club management software application called Tipsisocial (private repo)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open-source project
