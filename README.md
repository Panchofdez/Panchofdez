### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at Ryerson University looking to delve into the software engineering world. I'm interested in full-stack web-development, and machine learning. But really I just love to solve problems! 

#These are the technologies that I know and but I'm hoping to add much more to my toolbelt 
- Python
- JavaScript
- React/React-Native
- NodeJS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a club management software application called Tipsisocial (private repo)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the python web framework Flask and using SQL as a database for my projects
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open-source project
